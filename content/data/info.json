Meditation and absolute freedom? But what's the difference? I contain both, all the dualism is inside me - should I make borders between? What is \"I\", might I ask again? <br>Welcome to my cozy place. <br>People call me Red Sun. I'm ordinary slav interested in cars and, uhm, you know... Cars. This is the center of the whole universe spinning around it.<br>The Freedom. <br>The Power. <br>The Spirit. <br>If you are interested - stay here.</p>",
