title: Physical introduction.

> _Good writing is actually bad writing, but with lots of editing. - D. Perrell_

This blog started being planned as something commercial and a lot physical.  
At the current moment - I feel more like spiritual about this.  
Choosing between two doesn't make any sense - **reality** accepts everything.

When **reality** starts beating your face against the pavement you either start to understand or live and then die inside a bubble of stupidity. This bubble isn't 100% transparent, but protects you from some or the beatings your fate want to deliver.

I am not a public person, so my "real" name won't be present, as well with birthday.  
So I am introducing myself as Red Sun, born in 1994.  
I do love cars. A lot.  
Also I love weapons.  
I served in airborne.  
I served in rescue.  
I was a rifleman.  
I was a sapper.  
I was a diver.  
Those absolutely physical experiences give me clear understanding of one thing: life is all about shades. We are drowning in false dichotomies - physical or spiritual, war or peace, black or white; none of the above can be true.  
Fading the shades away takes the joy out of life, but keeps it simple.  
This is the way I understand the role God is serving to people: leaving a variety of laws, systems, rules and events - and designing a much simpler system.  
Simplifying complex systems adds layers to the bubble. Understanding them - makes it more transparent.  
So my final goal is to accept **reality.** To stop simplifying, but accept everything in it's complexity - this is the way I see joy of life. The way of absolute freedom.

Keep up with this blog - let's grow together.
